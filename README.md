NOTICE: Install "Input System" under Window -> Package Manager under the Unity Registry section in the Packages dropdown to get the input/aim system working. It will not detect controls otherwise.
This game uses twin-stick controls to allow Pixel Guy to aim and shoot the Fackus using mouse and space, and run around using WASD. Pixel Guy must get the USMEL air freshener dropped by the Fackus to help his smell problem before he becomes to smelly to exist (5 Seconds).
Mouse Position: Aim
WASD: Movement
Space: Shoot
I implemented twin-stick controls as mentioned, enemy "follow player" behavior, countdown timer UI element, and behavior for the player to "collect" air freshener bottles along with behavior for bullets to delete enemies.
The three sprite assets used I made myself.
